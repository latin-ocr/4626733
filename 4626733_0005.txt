STATEMENT ΟΝ ΒυΡΙ-ΙΟΑΤΕ ΙΜΑΕΕΞ

This reei of miorofiim contains materiei
which hes peper coior changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure thet eii text end illustrations ere
iegibie exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text end illustratione exist
in e sinqie image or when materiei
becquounds differ, such tremes may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure refiects the camere
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflects the

cernere operator’s best effort to capture

iliustretive materiei or the remaining text. it
is hoped thet this practice wiii resuit in e
microfiim prociuot thet fuiiy serves the needs
ot most reseerchers.
